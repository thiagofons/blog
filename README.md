# Personal Blog

> Where technology meets product strategy

This is the official repository for my **personal blog**, a space dedicated to exploring the intersection of high-quality software engineering and a strategic product vision. The content focuses on architecture, frontend development, and the technical decisions that drive business results.

⬆️ **SEO Optimized:** Semantic structure, dynamic metadata, and canonical URLs to ensure the best performance on search engines.
